# Apple Website

Apple is a well known company all around the world. So using some stock images and some basic bootstrap knowledge, I have made a multiple page static website.

## Features of this website

The most primary reason of creating this is to practice my bootstrap skills. This is the second of my bootstrap projects list.

- Mobile and Desktop Friendly
- Multiple Webpage
- Bootstrap 4(CDN)
- Smooth Scrolling Feature
- Scroll Spy Feature
- Highly Customizable
